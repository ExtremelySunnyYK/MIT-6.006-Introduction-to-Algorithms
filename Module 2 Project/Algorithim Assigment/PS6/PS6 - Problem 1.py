Problem Set 6: Social Network Friend Suggestion 

Problem:
designing an algorithm that computes the strength of the strongest connection
between a given user s and every other user v to whom s is connected with vagueness at most
k, in O(kE + V ) time (i.e., for every pair of s and v for v âˆˆ V \{s}, compute the strength of the
strongest connection between them with vagueness at most k). Assume that the network has |V |
users and |E| friend pairs. 

Solution:

Find the shortest path from s to v for all vertices with path less than or equals to k.
